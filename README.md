# wec-spring-2020
âš™ Waterloo Engineering Competition: Spring 2020 Programming submission! Check out the problem statement [here](/WECS20_ProgrammingPkg-final.pdf).

### To-Do

- [ ] finish back-front integration
- [ ] clean up the UI and front-end code
- [ ] maybe change stack so that we're not using two back-end languages
- [ ] pick a name for the product and stick with it ðŸ¤£

### Current Stack

* front-end: [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for using components and [Blueprint.js](https://blueprintjs.com/) for styling
* back-end: [Express (Node.js)](https://expressjs.com/) with Python to run requests (and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing the APIs used)
* APIs: [Google Scholar Results from SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/google-scholar-api), [Google Custom Search](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/using_rest), and [Bing Autosuggest from Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/autosuggest/)
